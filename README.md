# MVCFormPractice

I created this project so that I can practice implementing the repository design pattern, posting data (MVC forms), etc. It doesn't contain a database.

It is adapted from this treehouse project - https://github.com/treehouse-projects/aspnet-fitness-frog

In the project there is a "Data" folder which contains a repository and data class. The data cass is static and creates a list of books. The respository contains CRUD operations which returns the entire list of books, get the info for one specific book, etc.

NOTE - The code in this class (Data) is not to be considered a "best practice" example of how to do data persistence, but rather as workaround for not having a database to persist data to.

This project involves - 

Creating Forms for CRUD Applications
Handling Form Posts
Model State
Using HTML Helpers to Create Form Fields
Model Binding
Client-Side and Server-Side Form Validation
